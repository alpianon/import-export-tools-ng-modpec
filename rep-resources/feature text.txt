ImportExportTools NG is a fork of ImportExportTools NG.
It adds functionalities to export and verify SMIME messages and generate a hash list of the backup messages.
It is intended to be used to backup Italian Certified Email (PEC) messages.

ImportExportTools NG adds import and export functions for messages, folders and profiles.

This derivative add-on is the update of the original work of Paolo "Kaosmos", ImportExportTools.
The add-on is being updated for Thunderbird 68 (and 60) so that users can continue to enjoy the
functionality of this great add-on.

The first NG release, 4.0.0 , is a fork of v3.3.2 of the original add-on with the same functionality.
The name and icon have been changed to differentiate from the original version.
